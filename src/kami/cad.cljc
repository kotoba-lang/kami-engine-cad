(defn revolve
  "Revolve a closed planar profile about the Z axis into a closed topological
  solid of revolution — the rotational sibling of `extrude-polygon`.

  The system's pressure-bearing shape family (700-bar H2 cylinders, the
  replaceable Mg/MgH2 cartridge's cylindrical shell and heater bore) is
  axisymmetric, which a prism extruder cannot represent. This is the
  smallest upstream primitive for that family; `vdesign.cad` and
  `kotoba-lang/brep` both document revolve as not-yet-implemented, so
  packaging consumers currently cannot compose an axisymmetric solid at all.

  Input (all caller-supplied, fails closed with ex-info):
    profile  — ordered 3D points [x y z] in the XZ plane (y must be 0),
               x >= 0 (radius), at least two, consecutive points distinct.
               The profile is an OPEN polyline: an endpoint with x > 0 is
               closed by a disc cap of its revolution ring, while a point
               with x = 0 is an apex on the axis (cone tip / disc centre).
               To model a shape with an open bore (e.g. an annular
               cylinder), run the profile out to the bore radius, along the
               bore, and back to the axis — i.e. end the profile on the
               axis again — instead of leaving a ring endpoint.
               A segment lying ON the axis (both ends x = 0) is refused as
               degenerate.
    sectors  — positive integer >= 3: number of angular steps around the
               axis (explicit caller parameter — discretisation is never
               hidden; finer sectors converge to the true surface).

  Returns a watertight `:cad/kind :solid` with quad side faces (triangles
  at apexes), disc-cap fan faces at profile ends with x > 0, and the
  watertight topology asserted before returning (same discipline as
  `extrude-polygon`). Every edge of the result is shared by exactly two
  faces, verified by `watertight-solid?`.

  Composition boundary, disclosed: the result is a `:cad/kind :solid` and
  meshes (`solid-mesh`) and measures (`solid-volume`) fine, but the
  boolean ops below accept only `extrude-polygon` prisms and will refuse a
  revolve result loudly (ex-info) — that is their documented narrow-first-cut
  scope, not a silent misbehaviour.

;; Boolean solid operations: union / difference / intersect.
;;
;; Every solid this engine can currently produce is an `extrude-polygon`
;; result: a planar cross-section polygon rigidly translated by one
;; extrusion vector ("prism"). That gives every solid a product structure
;; (2D cross-section polygon) x (1D interval along the extrusion axis), which
;; is what makes a *genuinely correct*, tractable boolean possible here
;; without a general triangle-mesh/BREP boolean kernel (out of scope --
;; see ADR for the full writeup, following the same narrow-first-cut
;; discipline as org-iso-10303's axis-aligned-cylinder-only revolve).
;;
;; Supported input, for ALL THREE ops (anything else throws ex-info):
;;   - both solids must be watertight `extrude-polygon` prisms (2n vertices,
;;     n+2 faces, top = bottom rigidly translated by one vector);
;;   - the extrusion direction must be axis-aligned (exactly one of x/y/z
;;     nonzero) and the SAME coordinate axis for both solids ("coaxial" in
;;     the sense of a shared axis *direction* -- the two cross-section
;;     polygons may sit anywhere in the plane perpendicular to that axis,
;;     they need not share a common axis *line*);
;;   - each solid's cross-section polygon must be planar (both caps lie
;;     exactly in a plane perpendicular to the axis) and convex.
;;
;; `boolean-intersect` is unconditionally correct for any two such prisms:
;; the Cartesian-product identity (A1xB1) ∩ (A2xB2) = (A1∩A2)x(B1∩B2) holds
;; for arbitrary sets, so (cross-section-polygon intersection) x
;; (axis-interval intersection) IS exactly the solid intersection. Cross-
;; section intersection is computed with Sutherland-Hodgman convex clipping
;; (exact for convex-vs-convex, never introduces a hole).
;;
;; `boolean-union` / `boolean-difference` additionally require the two
;; solids to share an IDENTICAL cross-section polygon (same profile,
;; differing only in the axis interval -- e.g. stacking/cutting the same
;; rounded-rect profile at different heights along its own extrusion axis).
;; This extra restriction is deliberate, not an oversight: the analogous
;; product identity for union/difference does NOT hold in general --
;; (A1xB1) ∪ (A2xB2) != (A1∪A2)x(B1∪B2) unless A1=A2 or B1=B2 -- and general
;; convex-minus-convex cross-section subtraction can produce a
;; multiply-connected result (a polygon WITH A HOLE, e.g. a square frame),
;; which this engine's single-loop `extrude-polygon` cannot represent at
;; all. Rather than ship a booleans that is silently wrong off that
;; boundary, off-profile union/difference (e.g. biting a notch out of the
;; side of a box with a differently-shaped tool) is explicitly NOT
;; supported and throws.
;;
;; NOT supported (throws ex-info in all cases): non-axis-aligned extrusion
;; direction, mismatched extrusion axis between the two solids, non-convex
;; or non-planar cross-sections, self-intersecting polygons, and (for
;; union/difference only) mismatched cross-section profiles.
;;
;; Return shape: all three ops return a *vector* of 0..2 result solids
;; (never a bare solid), so callers have one consistent shape to handle:
;;   - `boolean-intersect` -> `[]` when the solids don't overlap, else `[s]`.
;;   - `boolean-union`     -> `[s]` when the axis intervals touch/overlap
;;     (merged into one solid), else `[a b]` (both originals, unmerged --
;;     this engine does not fuse two disjoint solids into one manifold).
;;   - `boolean-difference` (a minus b) -> `[a]` unchanged when b doesn't
;;     overlap a's interval, `[]` when b fully covers a's interval, else a
;;     vector of 1-2 solids for the remaining slab(s) of a's interval.
